## Overview
Network scanners play a crucial role in cybersecurity by providing organizations with the ability to identify, assess, and manage security risks within their network infrastructure. These tools are essential for maintaining the security and integrity of networks in the face of evolving cyber threats. By scanning network devices, ports, and services, organizations can gain visibility into their network topology and identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. 

The objective of this project is to leverage a set of foundational tools such as Nmap and Scrapy to establish a robust scanning functionality. By utilizing these tools, we aim to conduct comprehensive network scans to identify IP addresses, open ports, and other common identification specifications.
